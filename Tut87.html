                    Government of India is taking all necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared well to face the
                    challenge and threat posed by the growing pandemic of COVID 19 - the Corona Virus. With active
                    support of the people of India, we have been able to contain the spread of the Virus in our country.
                    The most important factor in preventing the spread of the Virus locally is to empower the citizens
                    with the right information and taking precautions as per the advisories being issued by Ministry of
                    Health & Family Welfare.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A: The most common symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and even death. The period within which the symptoms would appear is 2-14 days.

                    <p>

                        Q: How long does the coronavirus last on surfaces?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A: It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.
